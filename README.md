# Paid Search Campaign
This study analyses a real dataset from a paid search campaign run by a US shopping mall over a five-month period in 2021. Considering confidentiality, the name of the mall has been anonymised. The dataset includes important details about the advertising campaign, such as ad group info, clicks, conversions, impressions, revenue and cost.

* The project requires a summary of the performance of ad campaigns run between June and November 2021. The data should be displayed in a clear visual format and offer valuable guidance on the adverts to focus on in order to enhance the brand and drive more visitors to the website.

## Objectives
* Advertising Campaign Impact: identify which parts of the advertising campaigns have worked well and which need improvement.
* Management of Costs: it is crucial to utilise finances prudently. Can spend be reduced without sacrificing quality or effectiveness? Did the expenses incurred yield a satisfactory return on investment from the campaigns?
* Increasing conversion: getting more people to take an action, such as making a purchase. It is vital to discover which advertisements, keywords, or ad groups are most effective in driving the desired behaviour.
